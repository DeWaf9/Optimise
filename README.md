# Optimise
An optimisation/min-maxing tool for character creation in D&amp;D 5e

Written in Python 3.8, using no external packages. Ran via the Main.py file, and uses the other .py files for function calls and class construction.

It also contains a .exe, found in the dist\ folder, for ease of use on Windows machines that don't have a Python interpreter installed.
